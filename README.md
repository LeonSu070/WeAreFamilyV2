# WeAreFamilyV2

A simple Node.js web application to record family members and display a family tree as an organization chart.

## Setup

```
npm install
```

## Run

```
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

The `data/family.json` file now includes a `root` field specifying the ID of the
family member used as the single root node of the displayed tree. Only that
tree is rendered on the page.
