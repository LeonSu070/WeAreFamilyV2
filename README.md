# WeAreFamilyV2

A simple web application to record family members and display a family tree as
an organization chart.

## Run

Open `public/index.html` directly in your browser. The page loads
`family.json` from the same directory, so no web server is required.

The `public/family.json` file includes a `root` field specifying the ID of the
family member used as the single root node of the displayed tree. Only that
tree is rendered on the page.
